# Stock-Maker-Predictor

A stock prediction model to analyze stock trends using machine learning. This project predicts stock market trends and helps identify whether the stock is in a **bull** or **bear** phase. It uses historical stock data and applies machine learning algorithms to forecast the movement.

## Features

- Analyze historical stock data
- Predict whether a stock is in a **bull** or **bear** trend
- Provides insights into stock market performance using machine learning

## Libraries and Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs and visualizing data.
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- `yfinance`: For fetching historical stock data.
- `ta-lib` (optional): For technical analysis and stock indicators.

You can install all dependencies by using the following command:

pip install yfinance scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
